0.  BMP support most commonly use 24-bit color, which is 16.7 million colours,
    but also can support 32-bit color, which is 4.29 billion colors.
    GIF support 8-bit color - 256 colors.
    JPEG support 24-bit color - 16.7 million colours.
    PNG support 24-bit color - 16.7 million colours.
1.  GIF.
2.  The difference between lossy and lossless compression is that after lossless
    compression you can uncompress and original data will be recovered, instead, 
    lossy compression after uncompressing can lose some data. 
3.  JPEG format.
4.  Deleting a file rewrites the metadata that pointed to the file, but
    leaves the disk blocks containing the fileâ€™s contents intact. 
5.  I can use sanitation tools to ensure the files, that were deleted 
    cannot be recovered. Also, I can overwrite a hard disk by filling every 
    addressable block with NUL bytes or random characters
6.  The header file declares sets of integer types that have specified widths.
7.  These datatypes are fixed length, that means they are a cross-platform 
    implementation of a standard data type.
8.  BYTE - 1 byte, DWORD - 4 bytes, LONG - 4 bytes, WORD - 2 bytes.
9.  ASCII - "BM"; decimal - 6677; hexadecimal - 0x424D.
10. bfsize - size of bitmap file in bytes, bisize - size of the 
    BITMAPINFOHEADER in bytes.
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and it's origin is 
    the upper-left corner.
12. biBitCount.
13. Because there is no more free space in a filesystem to create a file or user 
    doesn't have permissions to create it.
14. Because it determines the number of elements fread will read. 
    This argument is always 1 because we are always reading one file.
15. 3.
16. Use fseek when you want to change the offset of the file pointer fp. 
    It allows you to change the location of the file pointer.
17. SEEK_CUR is an argument to fseek(), indicates current position of the 
    file pointer.
18. Rick Astley.
